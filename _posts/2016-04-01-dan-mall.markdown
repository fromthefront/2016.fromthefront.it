abstract: >
    Product shops, agencies, and web boutiques are often cut-throat environments that generally don't leave much space for learning and growth. Dan will talk about how the time-tested apprenticeship approach can be viable for almost any outfit and ultimately lead to happier employees, better work, and an industry that's healthier than we found it.
