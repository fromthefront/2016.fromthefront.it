talk: The modular design process
abstract: >
    We've been talking a lot recently about designing systems rather than pages, but what exactly is a design system? And why do some systems get better with time – more coherent and well functioning, while others get progressively worse – they become bloated, cumbersome, difficult to work with? Most importantly, once your design system is set up, how do you make sure that other people in your company can use it to achieve their goals, and that they would even *want* to work with that system?
    <br/><br/>
    In this talk we’ll look at how to create an enduring design system that people want to use. We’ll talk through the steps to get there, as well as mistakes, stumbling blocks, and lessons learned.
