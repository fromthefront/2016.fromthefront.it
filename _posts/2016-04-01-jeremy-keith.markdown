abstract: >
    Web browsers have become so powerful that developers are now treating them as if they were a runtime environment as predictable as any other. But the truth is that we still need to deal with many unknown factors that torpedo our assumptions.
    <br/><br/>
    The web is where Postel’s Law meets Murphy’s Law, so we can’t treat web development as if it were just another flavour of software. Instead we must work with the grain of the web.
    <br/><br/>
    You’ll learn tried and tested approaches to building for the web that will result in experiences that are robust, flexible, and resilient.
