talk: Psychology of Performance
time: "Day #2 - 09:45"
abstract: >
    Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them under 50 kilobytes” – these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about absolute values in kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests. Performance is not about Mathematics. Performance is about Perception. This talk is about perception, neuroscience and psychology.
