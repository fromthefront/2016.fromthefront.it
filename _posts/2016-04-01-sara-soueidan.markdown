talk: SVG IRL
abstract: >
    SVG has been established throughout the last couple of years as one of the most useful tools in our Web design and development toolkit. Its usefulness extends beyond displaying crisp images and icons. The image plus document characteristics of SVG means that it comes with a whole suite of useful features that can be used to display images and icons, create compelling infographics and even possibly replace flash ad banners. But dealing with SVG comes with a lot of questions and, a lot of times, a lot of compromises too. There are so many options and ways an SVG can be handled depending on where and how it's used.
    <br/><br/>
    In this talk, Sara will go over some practical examples and use cases of SVG. She will cover what considerations you need to take into account when using SVG, and how to make the most out of it, including how to make sure that everyone—including assistive technologies—can digest your content and experience it in the expected appropriate ways.
