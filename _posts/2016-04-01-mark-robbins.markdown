talk: Modern CSS and interactive email
abstract: >
    Email has often been overlooked as simplistic, outdated and limited but with modern webkit based email clients accounting for over 60% of opens the possibilities have really opened up. The new age of email is a fully interactive experience based in modern CSS (with a solid fallback for Outlook).We'll look over the code behind some of these new experiences we can offer in emails, such as (but not limited to): image galleries, price calculations, hotspots, animation and checkout.
