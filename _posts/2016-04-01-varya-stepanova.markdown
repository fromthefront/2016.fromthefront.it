talk: Doing nothing for visual regression testing
time: "Day #2 &mdash; 16:45"
abstract: >
    In this talk I will share my experience on introducing the least time-consuming way of implementing visual regression testing into the development process. This became possible after taking in work style-guide driven development approach and turned out to be very helpful for preventing unwanted interface changes and keeping websites making sense for users.
