    Look at the Web! It grows, it flexes, it is a chimera, never the same one day to the next. Other people make it look so obvious and easy. Other people build beautiful things, develop elegant standards, launch profound projects. Is it that the rest of us are inefficient and frenetic? Or is the webâ€™s awesome, impetuous progress making dilettantes of us all?
