talk: HTTP/2 What, where, why and when?!
time: "Day #2 - 10:30"
abstract: >
    The onset of HTTP/2 is upon us. Now over 75% of your users browsers support the low-latency transfer protocol, yet adoption has been slow.
    <br/><br/>
    What does this really mean for us as frontend developers? How can we utilise H2’s features to deliver fast experiences? Have our best practices become anti-patterns? What is the tooling landscape like and will we need to change our existing build systems?
    <br/><br/>
    Over the course of this talk Patrick will use new research and real-world examples from the Financial Times to put our minds at easy and – most importantly – get you excited about a future with HTTP/2.
